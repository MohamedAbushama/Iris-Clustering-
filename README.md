# Iris-Clustering-
Unsupervised Models for un labeled Iris dataset
Hierarchial Clustering dendrogram has been created to figure out the best K clusters to use
Confirmation of no of clusters to use by kmeans 
after choosing 3 clusters we hve fitted the dataset by kmeans with 3 clusters 
gave the each segment the proper flower name 
extract the best two featyres to use for better segmentation 
loadig the iris labeled dataset
done some classification models (SVM, Logistic regression, DecisionTree)
Evaluation parametters gave 100% accuracy
